Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website showcases my background, technical skills, projects, and professional experience. Built with React and designed with a modern dark theme, it provides potential employers, collaborators, and anyone interested in my work with a clear view of who I am and what I can do.
ðŸŒŸ Purpose
This portfolio serves as a professional yet personal platform where I can display my work, skills, and achievements in an easily accessible way. It functions as both a dynamic resume and an interactive showcase of my technical capabilities, giving visitors an opportunity to explore my work and get to know me better.
The website is designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing, reflecting both my design sense and technical capabilities.
